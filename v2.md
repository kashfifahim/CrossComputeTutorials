# Setting Up  Your Environment 

In order for us to start working on our automation we need to first prepare our environment.  In this section of the tutorial we are going to be using a machine with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with 1 CPU, 1GB of RAM and 25 GB of storage.  

## Is Your Operating System Up to Date?
Open up the terminal and type in 
```sudo apt update```
This command will check to see if anything in your operating system is up to date.  If the command returns with nothing, you're good to go.  On the other hand, the command may return a list of programs that need to be updated.  

```sudo apt update```
```apt list --upgradeable```
```sudo apt upgrade```

## Python3.9
Next, we need Python.  For the latest version of CrossCompute, we are going to need Python version 3.9 and higher.  

First let's check if python3.9 is already installed in your machine.  Type in ```python3.9``` and press enter.  If Python3.9 was already in your machine, you will then see a prompt from the Python3 interpreter. 

If you do not have Python3.9 you will see a message on how you can install Python3.9.  Let's go ahead and install Python3.9. Type into your command line interepreter ```apt install python3.9``` You will get a confirmation prompt, type ```y``` to install python3.9. Give it a few seconds for it to be installed, after which, if there are no errors you should have successfully intalled Python3.9.  Let's check: type ```python3.9``` again and see if the Python interpreter promp appears.  

Nice! So far we have our operating system packages up to date, checked and installed Python3.9 in our system. Next let's install pip. 

## Making Python3.9 Your Default Python3 Version

## Do You Have pip?
What is pip?  
Why do we need pip?
How do you check to see if pip is installed in your computer?
Let's install pip. 

```python3.9 -m pip --version```
If the interpreter returns ```No module named pip``` then it's time to install pip.

```apt install python3.9 -m pip```

## Do you have Python3.9 venv?
```python3.9 -m venv automation```
No? -> ```apt install python3.9-venv```
Yes -> ```source automation/bin/activate```

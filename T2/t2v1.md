## The Problem

Imagine youself as the new Arithmetic Analyst, at Mathematics Inc. On your first day, your manager sends you one hundred csv-files.  You open one and see that the file holds ten-thousand rows, with two columns, where each entry has what looks like a randomly generated decimal number. Your manager wants you to go through each file, go through each row, and calculate the sum, the difference, the product, the quotient, and finally, the average of two values.  Save the calculated values in a new file that's complementary to the name of the source file, saved in the same folder, and have it all done before lunch.

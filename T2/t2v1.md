## The Problem

Imagine youself as the new Arithmetic Analyst, at Mathematics Inc. On your first day, your manager sends you one hundred csv-files.  You open one and see that the file holds ten-thousand rows, with two columns, where each entry has what looks like a randomly generated decimal number. Your manager wants you to go through each file, go through each row, and calculate the sum, the difference, the product, the quotient, and finally, the average of two values.  Save the calculated values in a new file that's complementary to the name of the source file, saved in the same folder, and have it all done the end of the day.

Okay, you take a deep breath, you got this.  

You start by opening up the first csv file with Microsoft Excel.  

You investigate the data.  Just a lot of numbers.  You need a column for adding the two values, another column for finding the difference, and another one for the product, and another one for the quotient, and the last column for the average of the two values.  That means you need the sheet to compute five new columns for each row.  You then also remember that the calculated fields have to be saved to their own csv, within the same folder as the source sheets.  

You know Excel can do the calculations, no problem. The problem is going to be opening each of the one hundred files, setting up the rules, outputting them to a new csv file.  

You look at the clock and you get the feeling that Excel definitely won't be able to get the job done.

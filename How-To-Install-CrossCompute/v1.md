# On a Linux-Ubuntu Machine

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
1 CPU, 1GB RAM, 25 GB Storage

Open terminal, make sure your operating system is up to date:

```sudo apt update```

```sudo apt upgrade```

Do you have python3? In order for CrossCompute to work properly you must have atleats Python3 version 3.9.0 and up.

```python3 --version```
```Python 3.9.1```

Do you have pip?

```apt install pip```

Do you have python3 virtual environment?

```apt install python3.8-venv```

You might need to use sudo with the above command:

```sudo apt install python3.8-venv```

## Setting Up Your Environment

1. Create a Python virtual environment in a folder called crosscompute_project (or any other name you want).  This will also create a new folder with the name you selected:

``` python3 -m venv crosscompute_project ```

2. Activate the virtual environment

```source crosscompute_project/bin/activate```

2b. Check the list of pip packages in your virtual environment

```pip list```

You should see a few packages:

```
Package       Version
------------- -------
pip           20.0.2 
pkg-resources 0.0.0  
setuptools    44.0.0 
```

3. Install CrossCompute

``` pip install crosscompute```

Note: There's a chance that you might get an error, like this:

```error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'```

Do not worry. Run the command again to intall crosscompute.

4. Check to see what packages were installed.

```pip list```

You should see a new list of packages now installed in your virtual environment:

```
